    <p>Hi! I'm Anna and I'm so happy you're here!  I am an astrophysicist whose research interests include the formation and evolution of binary stars and terrestrial planets, habitability, and artificial intelligence. I develop numerical tools and use exisiting tools in the fields of astrophysics, chemistry, geology, and high pressure physics to produce planet formation models.  Some of my research has resulted in theoretical predicitions that have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories! I enjoy thinking about the habitability of other worlds in non-traditional ways to help guide observations in the search for life.</p> 
    </p> I’m very excited about how AI is starting to revolutionize astronomy. There’s so much observational data we’ve collected over the years—from sky surveys to missions like Kepler and TESS—and we’re really just scratching the surface of what we can do with it. AI and machine learning open up amazing possibilities to sift through this data and uncover hidden patterns or signatures that might have gone unnoticed with traditional methods. I’ve used machine learning to identify new binary systems in open clusters, and I’m eager to keep pushing that work forward—there’s so much potential still in datasets like Kepler and TESS to discover new objects. I am also experimenting with AI for science communication. I’ve been developing AI agents that help explain complex scientific findings in accessible ways, making astronomy more engaging and inclusive for the public.</p>  
      <p>Outside of astronomy, my interests include spending time with my family, reading and writing science fiction, hiking, camping, running, playing the violin, and advocating for animal rights and the environment.  I currently reside in Northern California with my family.</p>

<h2>In the Press</h2>
<p>One of my passions is sharing astronomy with the public. I recognize that being a researcher in this field is a privilege. While many others share the same reverence for the cosmos, they may not have had the same educational and professional opportunities that I’ve been fortunate to receive. This is not lost on me, and I feel a strong responsibility to share the latest astronomical discoveries with the public that supports my work.</p>

<p>The free press is one of the most important tools to help make astronomy accessible to everyone.  Below is a list of my contributions to some of these outlets:</p>
