    <p>Hi! I'm Anna and I'm so happy you're here!  I am an astrophysicist whose research interests include the formation and evolution of binary stars and terrestrial planets, habitability, and artificial intelligence. I develop numerical tools and use exisiting tools in the fields of astrophysics, chemistry, geology, and high pressure physics to produce planet formation models.  Some of my research has resulted in theoretical predicitions that have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories! I enjoy thinking about the habitability of other worlds in non-traditional ways to help guide observations in the search for life.</p> 
    </p> I'm very excited about the potential of AI in astronomy.  AI can help us find hidden signatures in the the vast amounts of observational data we have thus far collected.  With machine learning techniques I have identified new binary systems in open clusters and hope to find more objects in Kepler and TESS data!  I develop AI agents for science communication and engagement in my spare time.</p>

      <p>Outside of astronomy, my interests include spending time with my family, reading and writing science fiction, hiking, camping, running, playing the violin, and advocating for animal rights and the environment.  I currently reside in Northern California with my family.</p>

<h2>In the Press</h2>
<p>One of my passions is sharing astronomy with the public. I recognize that being a researcher in this field is a privilege. While many others share the same reverence for the cosmos, they may not have had the same educational and professional opportunities that I’ve been fortunate to receive. This is not lost on me, and I feel a strong responsibility to share the latest astronomical discoveries with the public that supports my work.</p>
