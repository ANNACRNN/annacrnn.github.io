    <p>Anna Childs is an astrophysicist whose research interests include the formation and evolution of binary stars and terrestrial planets, habitability, and artificial intelligence. She develops new numerical tools and integrates exisiting numerical tools in the fields of astrophysics, chemistry, geology, and high pressure physics to produce high-resolution models of planet formation.  Her research has resulted in theoretical predicitions that have been confirmed by the James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories. She enjoys thinking about the habitability of other worlds in non-traditional ways to help guide observations in the search for life.</p>  

    <p>Anna has authored 14 peer-reviewed publications and co-authored an additional 7 peer-reviwed publications. For a complete list of published work please visit:</p>
