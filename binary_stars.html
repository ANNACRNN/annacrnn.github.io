    <h1>Binary Stars and Tatooines</h1>
    <p>Most Sun-like stars in our galaxy are part of binary systems — they’re gravitationally bound to a companion star. This means that in our search for planets around Sun-like stars, we must consider how a stellar companion might influence the planet formation process. Planets can form around each individual star or orbit both stars together. When they orbit both stars, they’re called circumbinary planets — or “Tatooines,” a nod to Luke Skywalker’s home planet, which circled a binary star system. So far, we’ve discovered over a dozen circumbinary planets, and there are most certainly many more Tatooines waiting to be found!</p>

        <figcaption>Another counterintuitive idea is that giant impacts—such as the one that formed our Moon—may be essential for habitability. Without Earth’s violent history, we likely wouldn’t have a Moon, a magnetic field, a secondary atmosphere, or plate tectonics—all features closely tied to Earth’s ability to support life. By simulating the long-term stability of compact systems formed through pebble accretion, like TRAPPIST-1, we identified observable traits of systems that have undergone late-stage instabilities that resulted in giant impacts and, perhaps surprisingly, may be more likely to harbor habitable planets.
